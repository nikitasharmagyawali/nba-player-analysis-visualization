## Data Sources

This project uses two public NBA datasets:

- `seasons_stats.csv`: Season-level NBA statistics used to create NYT-inspired editorial visualizations of scoring styles and shot selection trends.
- `Per 36 Minutes.csv`: Per-36-minute player statistics used for network-based analysis of teammate relationships.

Raw data files are not included in this repository.
